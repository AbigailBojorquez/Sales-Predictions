## Model 
#### The models that were used were linier regression in order to lay  the foundaion for other machine learning algorithms. I also used the decision tree to find the metics of our data. Our decision Tree can account for about 46% of the variation in y_test using the features in X_test.
## Recommendations:
#### For future refences I would highly recomend to have a clear vision of what information you would like your data to give you. With that being said, it will allow for the data analyist to clearly extract and give a clear analysis of your data. Also, making sure when giving data, that all values are filled so that the analysis has a full set of data and will be able to give the most persise predictions.
